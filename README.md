üëã Hi there! I'm yshmodi, a curious learner with big dreams of becoming a well-rounded Full-Stack Developer! Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the exciting world of Angular, eager to unlock its potential in crafting dynamic and interactive web applications. üíª

**About Me:**
Passionate about learning new technologies and solving problems through code.
Currently, I'm knee-deep in Angular, soaking up knowledge from documentation, Udemy courses, and tinkering away on personal projects.
I'm totally open to collaborating with fellow devs and even diving into open-source projects down the line. Let's build cool stuff together! üöÄ

**Skills:**
Got a solid foundation in JavaScript and its frameworks (loved working with React).
Pretty handy with HTML, CSS, and a bunch of front-end dev tools.
Can't wait to level up with Angular as I go along!

**Learning Journey:**
Started off with Angular docs and some Udemy goodness.
Already have a handful of React projects under my belt - you can check 'em out on my GitHub!
Currently tinkering on small Angular projects to really nail down my understanding.
Super stoked to give back to the community and tackle bigger, more complex apps in the future!

**Interests:**
Obsessed with staying in the loop on web dev trends and best practices.
All about crafting user-friendly and efficient web experiences that make people go "Wow!"
Excited to explore how different technologies can come together to create comprehensive solutions.
